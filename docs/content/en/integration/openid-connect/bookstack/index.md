## Tested Versions

* [Authelia]
  * [v4.35.5](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/releases/tag/v4.35.5)
* [BookStack]
  * 20.10

## Before You Begin

You are required to utilize a unique client id and a unique and random client secret for all [OpenID Connect] relying
parties. You should not use the client secret in this example, you should randomly generate one yourself. You may also
choose to utilize a different client id, it's completely up to you.

This example makes the following assumptions:

* __Application Root URL:__ `https://bookstack.example.com`
* __Authelia Root URL:__ `https://auth.example.com`
* __Client ID:__ `bookstack`
* __Client Secret:__ `bookstack_client_secret`

## Configuration

### Application

To configure [BookStack] to utilize Authelia as an [OpenID Connect] Provider:

1. Edit your .env file
2. Set the following values:
   1. AUTH_METHOD: `oidc`
   2. OIDC_NAME: `Authelia`
   3. OIDC_DISPLAY_NAME_CLAIMS: `name`
   4. OIDC_CLIENT_ID: `bookstack`
   5. OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET: `bookstack_client_secret`
   6. OIDC_ISSUER: `https://auth.example.com`
   7. OIDC_ISSUER_DISCOVER: `true`

### Authelia

The following YAML configuration is an example __Authelia__
[client configuration](../../../configuration/identity-providers/open-id-connect.md#clients) for use with [BookStack]
which will operate with the above example:

```yaml
- id: bookstack
  description: BookStack
  secret: bookstack_client_secret
  public: false
  authorization_policy: two_factor
  redirect_uris:
    - https://bookstack.example.com/oidc/callback
  scopes:
    - openid
    - profile
    - email
  userinfo_signing_algorithm: none
```
