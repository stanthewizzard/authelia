It's important to note that this guide has a layout which we suggest as the best order in areas to tackle, but you may
obviously choose a different path if you are so inclined.

## Prerequisites

### Forwarded Authentication

Forwarded Authentication is a simple per-request authorization flow that checks the metadata of a request and a session
cookie to determine if a user must be forwarded to the authentication portal.

Due to the fact a cookie is use, it's an intentional design decision that *__ALL__* applications/domains protected via
this method *__MUST__* use secure schemes (`https` and `wss`) for all of their communication.

### OpenID Connect

Only requires Authelia to be use a secure scheme (`https`).

## Configuration

It's important to customize the configuration for *Authelia* in advance of deploying it. The configuration is static and
not configured via web GUI. You can find a
[configuration template](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/blob/master/config.template.yml) on GitHub which can be
used as a basis for configuration.

The important sections to consider in initial configuration are as follows:

1. [jwt_secret](../../configuration/miscellaneous/introduction.md#jwt_secret) which is used to sign identity
   verification emails
2. [default_redirection_url](../../configuration/miscellaneous/introduction.md#default_redirection_url) which is the
   default URL users will be redirected to when visiting *Authelia* directly
3. [authentication_backend](../../configuration/first-factor/introduction.md) which you must pick between
   [LDAP](../../configuration/first-factor/ldap.md) and a [YAML File](../../configuration/first-factor/file.md) and is
   essential for users to authenticate.
4. [storage](../../configuration/storage/introduction.md) which you must pick between the SQL Storage Providers, the
   recommended one for testing and lite deployments is [SQLite3](../../configuration/storage/sqlite.md) and the
   recommended one for production deployments otherwise is [PostgreSQL](../../configuration/storage/postgres.md).
5. [session](../../configuration/session/introduction.md) which is used to configure the session cookies, the
   [domain](../../configuration/session/introduction.md#domain) and
   [secret](../../configuration/session/introduction.md#secret) are the most important, and
   [redis](../../configuration/session/redis.md) is recommended for production environments.
6. [notifier](../../configuration/notifications/introduction.md) which is used to send 2FA registration emails etc,
   there is an option for local file delivery but the [SMTP](../../configuration/notifications/smtp.md) option is
   recommended for production.
7. [access_control](../../configuration/security/access-control.md) is also important but should be configured with a
   very basic policy to begin with. Something like:

  ```yaml
  access_control:
    default_policy: deny
    rules:
      - domain: "*.example.com"
        policy: one_factor
  ```

## Deployment

There are several methods of deploying *Authelia* and we recommend reading the
[Deployment Documentation](../deployment/introduction.md) in order to perform deployment.

## Proxy Integration

The default method of utilizing *Authelia* is via the [Proxy Integrations](../proxies/introduction.md). It's
recommended that you read the relevant [Proxy Integration Documentation](../proxies/introduction.md).

*__Important Note:__ When your [Deployment](#deployment) is on [Kubernetes](../kubernetes/introduction/index.md) we
recommend viewing the dedicated [Kubernetes Documentation](../kubernetes/introduction/index.md) prior to viewing the
[Proxy Integration Documentation](../proxies/introduction.md).*

## Moving to Production

We consider it important to do several things in moving to a production environment.

1. Move all [secret values](../../configuration/methods/secrets.md#environment-variables) out of the configuration and
   into [secrets](../../configuration/methods/secrets.md).
2. Spend time understanding [access control](../../configuration/security/access-control.md) and granularly configure it
   to your requirements.
3. Review the [Security Measures](../../overview/security/measures.md) and
   [Threat Model](../../overview/security/threat-model.md) documentation.
4. Ensure you have reviewed the [Forwarded Headers](../proxies/fowarded-headers/index.md) documentation to ensure your
   proxy is not allowing insecure headers to be passed to *Authelia*.
5. Review the other [Configuration Options](../../configuration/prologue/introduction.md).
