[NGINX] is a reverse proxy supported by __Authelia__.

*__Important:__ When using these guides it's important to recognize that we cannot provide a guide for every possible
method of deploying a proxy. These guides show a suggested setup only and you need to understand the proxy
configuration and customize it to your needs. To-that-end we include links to the official proxy documentation
throughout this documentation and in the [See Also](#see-also) section.*

## Get Started

It's __*strongly recommended*__ that users setting up *Authelia* for the first time take a look at our
[Get Started](../prologue/get-started.md) guide. This takes you through various steps which are essential to
bootstrapping *Authelia*.

## Requirements

You need the following to run __Authelia__ with [NGINX]:

* [NGINX] must be built with the `http_auth_request` module which is relatively common
* [NGINX] must be built with the `http_realip` module which is relatively common
* [NGINX] must be built with the `http_set_misc` module or the `nginx-mod-http-set-misc` package if you want to preserve
  more than one query parameter when redirected to the portal due to a limitation in [NGINX]

## Trusted Proxies

*__Important:__ You should read the [Forwarded Headers] section and this section as part of any proxy configuration.
Especially if you have never read it before.*

*__Important:__ The included example is __NOT__ meant for production use. It's used expressly as an example to showcase
how you can configure multiple IP ranges. You should customize this example to fit your specific architecture and needs.
You should only include the specific IP address ranges of the trusted proxies within your architecture and should not
trust entire subnets unless that subnet only has trusted proxies and no other services.*

[NGINX]'s `http_realip` module is used to configure the trusted proxies' configuration. In our examples this is
configured in the `proxy.conf` file. Each `set_realip_from` directive adds a trusted proxy address range to the trusted
proxies list. Any request that comes from a source IP not in one of the configured ranges results in the header being
replaced with the source IP of the client.

## Docker Compose

The following docker compose example has various applications suitable for setting up an example environment.

It uses the [nginx image](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-nginx) from [linuxserver.io] which includes all of the
required modules including the `http_set_misc` module.

It also includes the [nginx-proxy-confs](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-mods/tree/nginx-proxy-confs) mod where
they have several configuration examples in the `/config/nginx/proxy-confs` directory. This can be omitted if desired.

If you're looking for a more complete solution [linuxserver.io] also have an nginx container called [SWAG](./swag.md)
which includes ACME and various other useful utilities.

## Configuration

Below you will find commented examples of the following configuration:

* [Authelia Portal](#authelia-portal)
  * Running in Docker
  * Has the container name `authelia`
* [Protected Endpoint (Nextcloud)](#protected-endpoint)
  * Running in Docker
  * Has the container name `nextcloud`
* [Supporting Configuration Snippets](#supporting-configuration-snippets)
* Assumes the following since we cannot reasonably provide a configuration for every architecture:
  * [NGINX] is also running in Docker and uses Docker DNS as a
    [resolver](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#resolver) which is standard
  * [NGINX] shares a network with the `authelia` and `nextcloud` containers

### Standard Example

This example is for using the __Authelia__ portal redirection flow on a specific endpoint. It requires you to have the
[authelia-location.conf](#authelia-locationconf),
[authelia-authrequest.conf](#authelia-authrequestconf), and [proxy.conf](#proxyconf) snippets. In the example these
files exist in the `/config/nginx/snippets/` directory. The `/config/nginx/snippets/ssl.conf` snippet is expected to have
the configuration for TLS or SSL but is not included as part of the examples.

{{< details "/config/nginx/site-confs/auth.conf (Authelia Portal)" >}}
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name auth.*;

    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name auth.*;

    include /config/nginx/snippets/ssl.conf;

    location / {
        include /config/nginx/snippets/proxy.conf;

        set $upstream_authelia http://authelia:9091;
        proxy_pass $upstream_authelia;
    }
}
```

{{< details "/config/nginx/site-confs/nextcloud.conf (Protected Application - Nextcloud)" >}}
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name nextcloud.*;

    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name nextcloud.*;

    include /config/nginx/snippets/ssl.conf;
    include /config/nginx/snippets/authelia-location.conf;

    set $upstream http://nextcloud;

    location / {
        include /config/nginx/snippets/proxy.conf;
        include /config/nginx/snippets/authelia-authrequest.conf;

        proxy_pass $upstream;
    }
}
```

{{< details "/config/nginx/site-confs/whoami.conf (Protected Application - whoami)" >}}
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name whoami.*;

    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name whoami.*;

    include /config/nginx/snippets/ssl.conf;
    include /config/nginx/snippets/authelia-location.conf;

    set $upstream http://whoami;

    location / {
        include /config/nginx/snippets/proxy.conf;
        include /config/nginx/snippets/authelia-authrequest.conf;

        proxy_pass $upstream;
    }
}
```

### HTTP Basic Authentication Example

This example is for using HTTP basic auth on a specific endpoint. It is based on the full example above. It requires you
to have the [authelia-location-basic.conf](#authelia-location-basicconf),
[authelia-authrequest-basic.conf](#authelia-authrequest-basicconf), and [proxy.conf](#proxyconf) snippets. In the
example these files exist in the `/config/nginx/snippets/` directory. The `/config/nginx/snippets/ssl.conf` snippet is expected to have
the configuration for TLS or SSL but is not included as part of the examples.

The Authelia Portal file from the [Standard Example](#standard-example) configuration can be reused for this example as
such it isn't repeated.

{{< details "/config/nginx/site-confs/nextcloud.conf (Protected Application - Nextcloud)" >}}
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name nextcloud.*;

    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name nextcloud.*;

    include /config/nginx/snippets/ssl.conf;
    include /config/nginx/snippets/authelia-location-basic.conf; # Use the "basic" endpoint

    location / {
        include /config/nginx/snippets/proxy.conf;
        include /config/nginx/snippets/authelia-authrequest-basic.conf;

        set $upstream_nextcloud https://nextcloud;
        proxy_pass $upstream_nextcloud;
    }
}
```

### Supporting Configuration Snippets

The following configuration files are snippets that are used as includes in other files. The includes in the other files
match the headings, so if you wish to put them in a specific location or rename them, then make sure to update the
includes appropriately. Only the [proxy.conf](#proxyconf), [authelia-location.conf](#authelia-locationconf), and
[authelia-authrequest.conf](#authelia-authrequestconf) are required; see the descriptions for the others as to their
use cases.

#### proxy.conf

The following is an example `proxy.conf`. The important directives include the `real_ip` directives which you should read
[Trusted Proxies](#trusted-proxies) section to understand, or set the `X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Forwarded-Host`,
`X-Forwarded-Uri`, and `X-Forwarded-For` headers.

{{< details "/config/nginx/snippets/proxy.conf" >}}
```nginx
## Headers
proxy_set_header Host $host;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $http_host;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Uri $request_uri;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Ssl on;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
