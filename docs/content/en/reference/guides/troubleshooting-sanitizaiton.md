Some users may wish to hide their domain in files provided during troubleshooting. While this is discouraged, if a user
decides to perform this action it's critical for these purposes that you hide your domain in a very specific
way. Most editors allow replacing all instances of a value, utilizing this is essential to making troubleshooting
possible.

## General Rules

1. Only replace the purchased portion of domains:
   - For example if you have `auth.abc123.com` and `app.abc123.com` they
   should become `auth.example.com` and `app.example.com`, i.e. replace all instances of `abc123.com` with `example.com`.
2. Make sure value replaced is replaced with a unique value:
   - For example if you replace `abc123.com` with `example.com` DO NOT replace any other value other than `abc123.com` with
   `example.com`. The same rule applies to IP addresses, usernames, and groups.
3. Make sure the value replaced is replaced across logs, configuration, and any references:
   - For example if you replace `abc123.com` with `example.com` in your configuration, make exactly the same replacement
   for the log files.
4. Make sure this consistency is followed for all communication regarding a single issue.

## Multiple Domains

*__Replacement Value:__* `example#.com` (where `#` is a unique number per domain)

In instances where there are multiple domains it's recommended these domains are replaced with `example1.com`,
`example2.com`, etc.
